Code divided by projects (not in the GCP resource hierarchy "project" sense), project naming convention is: "demo-" followed by a number, info below will delineate what each project does, state associated deliverables and have related notes and links

Naming convention:

- GCP resources: e.g., demo-2, `this-bucket-does-something`, service-to-query-sql, database-for-cars
- tf resources: e.g., pubsub_demo_service, `database_for_cars`, demo_5_pubsub_topic
- java files/projects: no dashes or underscores (because I personally don't know what's allowed and what's not)
- tasks's status indicated with ‚úÖ/‚ùå/üöß

## _demo-1_

Objective: React app makes unauth'ed GET to API Gateway, API Gateway forwards request to Spring Boot Cloud Run service, service responds with "Hello World", React app displays response data\
Tasks & notes:

1. Hit service URL to make sure everything is working and the container returns a string ‚úÖ\
   _Not using a custom "demo-1" container image, using "hello-world" in ready-to-containerize dir_

## _demo-2_

Objective: Spring Boot Cloud Run service responds with message received from Pub/Sub, check service logs to validate, Pub/Sub message should be logged - using code (with modifications, e.g., not using jib to build, so had to create a Dockerfile) from [here](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/java-docs-samples/tree/master/run/pubsub)\
Tasks & notes:

1. Run `docker build -t demo-2 .` to validate Dockerfile ‚úÖ\
   _this is actually useless from config validation perspective, when running tf you could still get the Cloud Run service provisioning to error_
2. Create cloud-run, cloud-build, source-repo, iam, provider, vars, pubsub tf files ‚úÖ
3. Push container image to Container Registry ‚úÖ
4. Run tf code ‚úÖ\
   _pom.xml `artifactId` and `name` is **demo2**, same as what's in Dockerfile preceding `.jar` and also on the top of Java files (e.g., `package com.example.demo2;`) this consistency is important otherwise you'll get errors when building the service_
5. Publish a message with command `gcloud pubsub topics publish demo-2-topic --message "World"` and validate in Cloud Run service logs ‚úÖ
6. Add `cloudbuild.yaml` to source code and validate in Cloud Build that container image is built and pushed to Container Registry ‚úÖ
7. Make changes to source code and validate in Cloud Run service logs that Cloud Build built a new image ‚úÖ\

## _demo-3_

Objective: Design a Cloud DLP transformation for a sample dataset. Create Cloud DLP templates to store the transformation configuration. _I.e., what's [here](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/creating-cloud-dlp-de-identification-transformation-templates-pii-dataset)_
Tasks and notes:

1. Write tf code for buckets - The first bucket stores the sample dataset and the second bucket stores temporary data for the automated pipeline ‚úÖ

## _demo-4_

Objective: Set up API Gateway with GET that returns "hello world" from Java Spring Boot Cloud Run service
Tasks and notes:

1. Write tf code
