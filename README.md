Code divided by projects (not in the GCP resource hierarchy "project" sense), project naming convention is: "demo-" followed by a number, info below will delineate what each project does, state associated deliverables and have related notes and links

## _demo-1_

React app makes unauth'ed GET to API Gateway, API Gateway forwards request to Spring Boot Cloud Run service, service responds with "Hello World", React app displays response data
| Deliverables | Status (‚úÖ/‚ùå/üöß) | Notes | Links |
| ------------ | ------ | ------ | ----------- |
| Hit service URL to make sure everything is working and the container returns a string | ‚úÖ | Not using a custom "demo-1" container image, using "hello-world" in ready-to-containerize dir | none |
| Do another thing | ‚úÖ | It was also very hard! | bye |
| Do another thing | üöß | Still working on it | bye |

## _demo-2_

Spring Boot Cloud Run service responds with message received from Pub/Sub, check service logs to validate, Pub/Sub message should be logged

- using code (with modifications, e.g., not using jib to build, so had to create a Dockerfile) from [here](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/java-docs-samples/tree/master/run/pubsub)
